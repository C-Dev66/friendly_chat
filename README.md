## Description

Application is built with Google's Flutter front-end as well their native back-end service Firebase.

- **Firebase Authentication** to allow your users to sign in to the app.
- **Cloud Firestore** to save structured data on the cloud and get istant notification when data changes.
- **Firebase Security** Rules to secure the database.

Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL database, and data stored in the database is split into collections, documents, fields, and subcollections.

We will store each message of the chat as a document in a top-level collection called guestbook.

flutter pub add cloud_firestore
flutter pub add provider

// Installing flutterfire

dart pub global activiate  flutter_cli

// Configuring your app

flutterfire configure
```

> Adding user sign-in RSVP
```dart
Consumer<ApplicationState>(
	builder: (context, appState, _) => Authentication(
		email: appState.email,
        loginState: appState.loginState,
        startLoginFlow: appState.startLoginFlow,
        verifyEmail: appState.verifyEmail,
        signInWithEmailAndPassword: appState.signInWithEmailAndPassword,
        cancelRegistration: appState.cancelRegistration,
        registerAccount: appState.registerAccount,
        signOut: appState.signOut,
    ),
),

```

> Writing Messages to Cloud Firestore
```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';

Future<DocumentReference> addMessageToGuestBook(String message) {
	if (_loginState != ApplicationLoginState.loggedIn) {
      throw Exception('Must be logged in');
    }

    return FirebaseFirestore.instance
        .collection('guestbook')
        .add(<String, dynamic>{
      'text': message,
      'timestamp': DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
      'name': FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser!.displayName,
      'userId': FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser!.uid,
    });
}

Consumer<ApplicationState>(
     builder: (context, appState, _) => Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
            if (appState.loginState == ApplicationLoginState.loggedIn) ...[
                const Header('Discussion'),
                GuestBook(
                    addMessage: (message) =>
                        appState.addMessageToGuestBook(message),

            ],
        ],
    ),
),
```

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /guestbook/{entry} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid != null;
      allow write:
      if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId
          && "name" in request.resource.data
          && "text" in request.resource.data

    }
  }
}
```
